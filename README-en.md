### üéØ About the project

<p>
  DevCalc is, essentially, a calculator "for developers" which, in addition to being visually customizable, allowing the creation of custom themes, proposes to provide from basic mathematical calculations to more complex ones, such as Fibonacci Sequence, Trigonometric Functions and operations that involve the use of parentheses, all to provide a better experience for the user who is in constant contact with the world of mathematics.
